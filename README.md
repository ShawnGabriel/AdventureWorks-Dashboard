# Project Background

### Overview
Handling big data solutions and real-time analytics requires robust tools and well-designed pipelines to ensure efficiency and scalability. Manually managing data integration and transformation processes can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this, we developed an end-to-end data engineering project leveraging Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive pipeline that facilitates data ingestion, transformation, and analytics while showcasing best practices in data engineering.

### Objectives
- Design and implement a data pipeline using Azure Data Factory to streamline data ingestion.
- Leverage Databricks and Apache Spark for efficient data integration and transformation.
- Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics for scalable data warehousing and analytics.
- Demonstrate real-time data processing and big data solutions using industry-leading tools.
- Provide insights into Azure Data Engineer interview questions and practical scenarios.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Data Integration:** Azure Data Factory for orchestration and data flow automation.
- **Data Transformation:** Databricks with Apache Spark for big data processing.
- **Data Warehousing:** Azure Synapse Analytics for scalable analytics and querying.
- **Development:** Pyspark for real-time data processing and ETL tasks.

This project enhances the ability of data engineers to handle large-scale data efficiently, showcasing the synergy between Azure's data tools while providing practical insights into real-world use cases.
